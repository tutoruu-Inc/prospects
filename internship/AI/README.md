# SWE Intern - AI/TypeScript

## Task 1: Build a Simple Chatbot

**Objective:**
Create a basic chatbot using a pre-trained language model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3) with a TypeScript backend.

**Requirements:**

- Set up a Node.js server using TypeScript.
- Integrate the OpenAI API (or similar) to handle chatbot responses.

- Instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.

## Task 2: Add Natural Language Processing (NLP) Features

**Objective:**
Enhance the chatbot with additional NLP features such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition.

**Requirements:**

- Integrate an NLP library (e.g., Natural, Compromise, or spaCy) with the TypeScript backend.
- Add sentiment analysis to classify user messages as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Implement entity recognition to identify and highlight entities like dates, names, and locations in user messages.
- Update the frontend to display sentiment and recognized entities.

**Deliverables:**
