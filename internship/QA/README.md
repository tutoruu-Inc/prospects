## Task 1: Write and Execute Test Cases for a Web Application

**Objective:**
Create detailed test cases for a simple web application and execute them to identify bugs.

**Requirements:**

- Choose a sample web application (e.g., a simple e-commerce site or a to-do app).
- Write test cases for key functionalities (e.g., user login, adding items to cart, checkout process, adding tasks, marking tasks as completed).
- Execute the test cases and document the results.
- Report any bugs found with detailed steps to reproduce.

**Deliverables:**

- A document with written test cases (use a standard format including test steps, expected results, and actual results).
- A bug report document listing any issues found.

## Task 2: Automate Test Cases Using Selenium

**Objective:**
Automate the execution of test cases written in Task 1 using Selenium.

**Requirements:**

- Set up a test automation framework using Selenium WebDriver with a language of your choice (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript).
- Automate the test cases for key functionalities of the chosen web application.
- Ensure that the automated tests can be run on multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Generate test reports showing the results of the automated test runs.

**Deliverables:**

- Source code repository with the automated test scripts.
- Instructions on how to set up and run the automated tests.
- Test reports generated from running the automated tests.

## Task 3: Performance Testing with JMeter

**Objective:**
Conduct performance testing on a web application using Apache JMeter.

**Requirements:**

- Choose a sample web application to test.
- Create a JMeter test plan to simulate multiple users accessing the application simultaneously.
- Define performance metrics to measure (e.g., response time, throughput, error rate).
- Execute the performance tests and analyze the results.
- Identify any performance bottlenecks and suggest potential improvements.

**Deliverables:**

- JMeter test plan file.
- A document detailing the performance test results and analysis.
- Recommendations for improving the performance of the application.
